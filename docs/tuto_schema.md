# Understanding CartAGen data schema for generalization
CartAGen uses a centralized data schema to load and generalize geographic information, following the principles of multiple-representation databases (see [Balley et al. 2004][1] for instance). This page explains how it works, describes the content of the centralized schema, and shows how to extend it if necessary.
